# Installation

The simulation is implemented in Python and requires the following libraries:

- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `qiskit`
- `scipy`
- `typing`
- `datetime`
- `time`
- `bluequbit` (for interfacing with the quantum computing platform)
- seaborn

To set up the environment, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-name>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   You can install the required libraries using `pip`. Run the following command in the root of the repository:

   ```bash
   pip install numpy matplotlib qiskit scipy seaborn bluequbit
   ```

3. **BlueQubit Authentication**:
   The simulation requires a BlueQubit authentication token to connect to the quantum computing backend. To obtain the token, sign up for an account on [BlueQubit’s website](https://www.bluequbit.io/) and retrieve your API key. Store the token in a secure place, as you’ll need to input it when running the simulation.

4. **Running the Simulation**:
   Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the main script using:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

This will initiate the simulation, run validation tests, and produce the results and visualizations as specified in the code.
